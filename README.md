## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The challenge to building the app was that I wasn't the Kotlin language.
I never developed in Kotlin but it was pretty easy to pick up.
The issue was Android Studio. I wasn't familiar with the IDE
so it took me quite a bit of time to get familiar with it to do the necessary work.

Once that hurdle was overcome, the actual work on the app itself wasn't that difficult.
